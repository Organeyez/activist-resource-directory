### Project Motivation
Activists, community organizers, and social justice organizations put a lot of passion and effort into evolving systems to be more just and compassionate. The work is time consuming and a lot of this time is spent searching for information. Once an activist finds or creates the information they need, what can they do to make it easier for others to find that same information? 

This question motivated me to create Your Activist Resource Directory (YARD). YARD allows users to add links to online resources that are then visible to the public. Users can sift through resources and add their favorite resources to collections. All of a user's created resources, favorited resources, and collections make up their "User Library".  The power of this application is the ability for users to share their library with others. I envision this web app being used by established organizations and activists to spread information in an organized manner. Social media activists can share their libraries with their followers. Non-profit organizations can share their libraries with their employees and volunteers. Powerpoints, reports, and public policy documents can be shared between organizations running campaigns accross the country.

YARD aims to create a more connected and knowledgeable community of activists.  

YARD is a work in progress but the MVC has been released for people to use and I plan to continually update this app with new technologies including a more advanced searching mechanism, and machine learning algorithms that recommend resources to users based on their browser history.
